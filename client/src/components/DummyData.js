    description: 'Back with a delicious, fruity jammy bang is Caballero from Honduras! Some of you might remember the husband and wife team behind this great coffee, Moisés Herrera and Marysabel Caballero. Traditionally working with washed coffees because of their super humid climate, Moisés and Marysabel are prime examples of how atypical processing can often be a good way for producers to diversify their offerings. Over the last few years, the Caballeros have been working closely with Nordic Approach and their sister company Tropic, to develop fruity profiles within their supply chains. As a result, Moisés began experimenting with several natural protocols designed to produce specific flavour profiles; some crisp and punchy and some boozy and syrupy. With distinct body and flavour, we love the wildly tasty, fruit-forward characteristics Caballero #131 has to offer!',

    description: 'For those of us who love Costa Rican coffee, there is no better time on the coffee calendar than the El Vendaval time of the year. A Square Mile classic from the Calderon family, El Vendaval embodies the creamy texture, caramelised sweetness and soft acidity typical of coffees from the Tarrazú region. Processing their own coffee at their Los Angeles mill, alongside El Vendaval, the Calderons own Los Girasoles and Quebrada Grande, making up a large chunk of the magic that forms our seasonal Costa Rican offering. One of the best comforts to have through the colder months, we love experiencing the year on year nuances in taste, consistent quality and overall delight this coffee offers. Opening with a soft orange acidity, caramel mouthfeel and distinct almond finish, El Vendaval never fails to put a smile on our face.'

    description: 'The first coffee in our biggest Mexico showcase to date, we’re thrilled to welcome Flor de Capítan to our shop! Accompanied by a blog series, join us as we take a deeper look into coffee from Mexico and its industry. Leading the way, Flor de Capítan is a must-taste for so much more than a cup brimming with balanced acidity and a sweet, smooth, rounded mouthfeel. It represents the collective, one of the main themes within this project. The coming together of our partners in Chiapas, Ensambles, and Capítan, a small organisation that works with producers from four municipalities spanning the highest altitudes of the Jaltenango region of Chiapas. Head over to our blog to read more about how a combined lot like Flor de Capítan and Ensambles offer the members of Capítan access to better prices for their coffee crops.'

    description: 'A new coffee for us, we’re very excited to share Yabitu from Uraga, Ethiopia. We know this part of Guji well as we have been buying coffees from Uraga for some years now. Coffees from this region are consistently very expressive and flavour intensive. This lot combines cherries from around 500 smallholders with farms between 1-3ha in size, growing a mix of Welisho, Dega and regional landrace varieties. Once delivered to the washing station, the cherries are hand-sorted before being pulped and graded and left to wet ferment for 36 hours. Careful washing, further grading and drying over 10 days contributes to the sweet, clean, balanced notes evident in the cup. This lot has the typical fruit-forward characteristics that we usually find in coffees from Uraga as well as great structure and balance, layered florals and a delicoius tea-like mouthfeel.'

    description: "As part of our Collaboration Project with North Star Coffee Roasters in Leeds, we were introduced to Roberto Landaverde from Chaltenango in El Salvador through our import partners Caravela. After growing commercial-grade coffee on his farm Los Pinos for some years, Roberto recently turned his attention to speciality grade coffee for a better income. With a focus on improving fertilisation processes and pest control, Roberto improved both the health of his trees and increased the quality of his coffee. In a position to invest a little more into his farm every year, the progress, growth, and incremental enhancement on the quality of Los Pinos is remarkable! Offering a balanced, smooth cup filled to the brim with notes of orange, pistachio and a syrupy texture, we can't wait to see what next season brings! For more on Roberto, our plans for the future, head over to our blog!"

    description: 'A pure delight, get ready for Datanlí from Nicaragua! All about texture and balance, Datanlí offers sweet comfort in a cup. Named after a small town in the Municipality of Jinotega, Datanlí is produced by medium and small-scale producers. This lot is a combined lot from 5 farmers: Marvin, Juan, Jhon, Rosa and Domingo, and apart from the sheer delight this coffee offers, we were drawn to it because it is from Jinotega. Traditionally, the go-to Nicaraguan region for big volumes ideal for blends and commercial grades, compared to Nueva Segovia, considered the cradle of speciality coffee, Jinotega is often overlooked. Offering a lighter, tea-like profile quite different from other Nicaraguan regions, the consistency and quality to come from Jinotega is worth taking note of. The perfect morning wake me up; Datanlí is precisely what this Autumn needs. Sweet, creamy comfort.'

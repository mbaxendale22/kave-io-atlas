    about:
      '80 Stone Coffee Roasters are a duo who are more than a little obsessed with all things coffee-related. Simone and Roberto’s story started in London, back in the glory days of 2006, while working together in a restaurant. But let’s go back to the beginning… Roberto grew up in his family run coffee shop in Verona, and has always been in hospitality. He also happens to be a whiz at financial management and with finely-tuned organisational skills. Roberto left London in 2008 and started running his own busy coffee & wine bar in Verona. Simone has spent over 17 years in the coffee industry, in everything from barista training, speciality coffee roasting and coffee exporting. He even upped sticks from his London life in 2010, after finishing in 6th place at the UK Barista Championship, and moved to Guatemala to learn more tricks of the trade. He got involved with a coffee exporting company and judged barista competitions throughout Central America. He also secured 2nd place at the Italian coffee cupping competition in 2012. While they have different backgrounds, they make a team as balanced as their tastiest blends.',

    about:
      'Alchemy is an independent, family run business with a vibrant story to tell.Following a backpacking trip around central America in 2000, Anne and Joe O’Hara decided to move on from their corporate jobs.  We identified a gap in the event market – no one was doing impressive specialty coffee at events.The idea was to make the highest quality coffee – anywhere. We developed a number of pioneering methods to enable us to set up and deliver exceptional coffee at venues all over the world – from corporate  to VIP events –for guests ranging from royalty and rock stars. From selling coffees at the Henley Regatta, it wasn’t long before we were asked to make coffees for the artists backstage at Glastonbury – which we’ve now done at every Glastonbury since 2005. We’ve had amazing opportunities to meet incredible artists at Pyramid and Other over the years and watch some fantastic performances. By 2008 we had decided to roast our own coffee, as we struggled with the quality of coffee we were able to purchase, especially if we needed a large volume of specialty coffee at very short notice. Passionate about coffee and the people who make it, Joe and Anne’s earlier experiences backpacking around Central America in 2000 helped them to form a genuine and wholehearted sentiment for coffee producing communities – a huge part of what fuels Alchemy’s ethos today. At present, roughly 70 percent of the coffee that we roast is sourced through Direct Trade relationships. Visiting the people that grow the coffee at origin and getting to know them and what they do is incredibly important to us. We believe in human interaction, not just a business transaction – so amongst all the business and coffee chat, it’s essential for us to sit down and get to know the producers on a personal level over dinner, making sure we have plenty of time to talk about anything BUT coffee. Continuously curious and passionate about what we do, we’ve come a long way since 2004. We have supplied numerous coffee shops, restaurants and hotels – as well as establishing two of our own cafes in London and running a coffee events and engineering business. And that, is how Alchemy was born.',
